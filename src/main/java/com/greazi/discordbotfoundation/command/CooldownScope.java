/**
 * A series of {@link Enum}s used for defining the scope size for a
 * {@link Interaction}'s cooldown.
 *
 * <p>The purpose for these values is to allow easy, refined, and generally convenient keys
 * for cooldown scopes, allowing a command to remain on cooldown for more than just the user
 * calling it, with no unnecessary abstraction or developer input.
 *
 * Cooldown keys are generated via {@link SimpleCommand#getCooldownKey(CommandEvent)
 * Command#getCooldownKey(CommandEvent)} using 1-2 Snowflake ID's corresponding to the name
 * (IE: {@code USER_CHANNEL} uses the ID's of the User and the Channel from the CommandEvent).
 *
 * <p>However, the issue with generalizing and generating like this is that the command may
 * be called in a non-guild environment, causing errors internally.
 * <br>To prevent this, all of the values that contain "{@code GUILD}" in their name default
 * to their "{@code CHANNEL}" counterparts when commands using them are called outside of a
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild Guild} environment.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link CooldownScope#GUILD GUILD} defaults to
 *     {@link CooldownScope#CHANNEL CHANNEL}.</li>
 *     <li>{@link CooldownScope#USER_GUILD USER_GUILD} defaults to
 *     {@link CooldownScope#USER_CHANNEL USER_CHANNEL}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These are effective across a single instance of JDA, and not multiple
 * ones, save when multiple shards run on a single JVM and under a
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.sharding.ShardManager ShardManager}.
 * <br>There is no shard magic, and no guarantees for a 100% "global"
 * cooldown, unless all shards of the bot run under the same ShardManager,
 * and/or via some external system unrelated to JDA-Utilities.
 *
