# About this project

This project has been started by Greazi and has become a community project. It is a bootstrap system to code a
DiscordBot even faster.
It is based on the Discord JDA API and is written in Java. This system brings a lot of system pre-made allowing you to
code your bot faster.

We are working hard on getting the api docs and a wiki online. Because this project has just started and is only maintaned by 2 individuals
at this moment we are working as hard as we can on these things.

***

# How to import

We use JitPack to automatically compile and host the latest release of DiscordBot Foundation for you.
You can eitehr use Jitpack or download and import the project manually.

## Jitpack
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/Greazi-Times/Discord_Bot_Foundation.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Greazi-Times/Discord_Bot_Foundation)

**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Greazi-Times</groupId>
    <artifactId>Discord_Bot_Foundation</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

## Locally

If you have the DiscordBot Foundation installed on your computer you are able to import it directly (Requires knowledge
on how to host a dependency locally!)
This way all changes you make will be directly visible and usable in your project.
You will need to add the following lines to your maven file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.greazi</groupId>
    <artifactId>DiscordBotFoundation</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

***

## Keep your fork up to date

You can keep your fork, and thus your private DiscordBot Foundation up to date with the upstream using
GitHubs' [Sync Fork button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
. You can also use the [pull](https://github.com/wei/pull) package created by [@wei](https://github.com/wei) to automate
this process.

## :sparkling_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff,
there are a few ways you can do it:

- Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it :D
- Starring and sharing the project :rocket:
- [![paypal.me/GreaziTime](https://ionicabizau.github.io/badges/paypal.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/GreaziTime) - You
  can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:

Thanks! :heart:
